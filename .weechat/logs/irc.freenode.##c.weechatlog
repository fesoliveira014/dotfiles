2017-09-29 16:57:38	loadedanvils	what would be my alternatives if the POSIX function I want does not exist on my systen
2017-09-29 16:57:46	loadedanvils	this is a general question
2017-09-29 16:58:03	loadedanvils	not for a specific function
2017-09-29 16:59:00	nchambers	loadedanvils: implement it yourself?
2017-09-29 16:59:12	loadedanvils	luckily, windows has a reference
2017-09-29 16:59:13	zcram	in ye'olden days, they'd tell you to write yuor own...
2017-09-29 16:59:25	loadedanvils	yeah, I guess so

2017-09-29 16:59:37	loadedanvils	where would I start with that though, assembly?
2017-09-29 17:00:10	nchambers	generally if I want a function in C I write it in C
2017-09-29 17:00:18	loadedanvils	right now I'm looking at the CAN protocol
2017-09-29 17:00:29	loadedanvils	oh, I mean a system function
2017-09-29 17:00:57	loadedanvils	for example, if I wanted to write posix time on a Windows box (though there is a function for this)
